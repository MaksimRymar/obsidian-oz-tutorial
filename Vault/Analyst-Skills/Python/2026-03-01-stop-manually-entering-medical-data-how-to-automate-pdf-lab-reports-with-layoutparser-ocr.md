## What’s new and why it matters
We’ve all been there: staring at a blurry, scanned PDF of a medical lab report, trying to figure out if that "Glucose" level is actually within the normal range. In the world of Data Engineering , medical documents are the ultimate "black box." Unlike digital PDFs, scanned reports don't have text layers; they are just grids of pixels. If you're building a health-tech app or a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline for medical records, you need more than just raw text. You need Automated Data Extraction and Document AI to turn those pixels into structured, actionable insights. In this tu…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
