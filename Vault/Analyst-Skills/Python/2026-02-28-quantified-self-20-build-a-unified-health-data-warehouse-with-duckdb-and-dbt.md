## What’s new and why it matters
Ever tried to compare your Oura sleep score with your Garmin body battery, only to realize you’re comparing apples to... well, very differently formatted oranges? If you're a data nerd like me, you probably track everything. But the "Quantified Self" dream quickly turns into a nightmare when you're juggling JSON exports from Oura, messy CSVs from Fitbit, and timezone-conflicted data from Garmin. In this tutorial, we are going to solve the fragmented data problem by building a local Modern Data Stack (MDS) . We’ll use DuckDB as our powerhouse engine and dbt (data build tool) to transform raw, m…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
