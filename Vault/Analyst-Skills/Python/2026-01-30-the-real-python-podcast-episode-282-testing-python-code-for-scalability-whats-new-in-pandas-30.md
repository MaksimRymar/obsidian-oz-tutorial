## What’s new and why it matters
How do you create automated tests to check your code for degraded performance as data sizes increase? What are the new features in pandas 3.0? Christopher Trudeau is back on the show this week with another batch of PyCoder's Weekly articles and projects.

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
