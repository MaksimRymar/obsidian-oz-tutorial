## What’s new and why it matters
Multithreading vs Multiprocessing in Python If you're working in Backend Development, Data Science, Automation, or preparing for Python interviews, understanding Multithreading, Multiprocessing, and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is absolutely essential. Many developers think both are the same because both deal with concurrency. They are not. The difference directly impacts performance, scalability, and CPU utilization. The short version: ** Multithreading = Shared memory, best for I/O-bound tasks Multiprocessing = Separate memory, best for CPU-bound tasks** Now let’s break it down clearly…
