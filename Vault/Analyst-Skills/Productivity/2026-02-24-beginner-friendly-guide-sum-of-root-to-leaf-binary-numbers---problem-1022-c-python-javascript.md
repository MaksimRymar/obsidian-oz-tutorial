## What’s new and why it matters
Binary trees are the backbone of hierarchical data structures, and understanding how to traverse them is a fundamental skill for any developer. This problem challenges you to view a path from the root to a leaf as a sequence of bits, turning a tree traversal into a mathematical calculation. It is a perfect way to practice Depth First Search (DFS) while brushing up on your binary-to-decimal conversions. Problem Summary You're given: A binary tree where every node contains either a 0 or a 1. Each path starting from the root and ending at a leaf node represents a binary number. Your goal: Calcula…
