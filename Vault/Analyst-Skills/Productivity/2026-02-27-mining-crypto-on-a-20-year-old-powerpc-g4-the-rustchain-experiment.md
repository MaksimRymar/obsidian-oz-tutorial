## What’s new and why it matters
Mining Crypto on a 20-Year-Old PowerPC G4: The RustChain Experiment Why Old Hardware Should Earn More In the world of cryptocurrency mining, there's an arms race. Faster GPUs, specialized ASICs, massive data centers consuming megawatts of power. But what if we flipped the script? What if older, slower hardware earned MORE than cutting-edge machines? That's the radical idea behind RustChain and its Proof-of-Antiquity consensus mechanism. The Problem with Traditional Mining Traditional Proof-of-Work blockchains reward raw computational power: Bitcoin: Whoever has the most hash rate wins Ethereum…
