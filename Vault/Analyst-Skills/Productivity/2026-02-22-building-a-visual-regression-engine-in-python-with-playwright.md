## What’s new and why it matters
Modern frontend applications are complex, responsive, and constantly evolving. Small CSS or layout changes can introduce subtle UI regressions that are hard to detect during manual review. I wanted a deterministic way to: Capture responsive screenshots across breakpoints Compare changes against an approved baseline Fail CI if layout drift exceeds a threshold So I built PixelFrame - a CLI-based visual regression engine powered by Python and Playwright. The Problem Visual regressions are tricky because: They may only appear on specific breakpoints They may not break functionality They are hard t…
