## What’s new and why it matters
In cybersecurity, automation is not optional — it’s essential. While working on a small security automation project, I wanted to bridge the gap between traditional command-line tools and programmable workflows. Nmap is one of the most powerful and widely used network scanning tools, but running it manually every time limits scalability. That’s when I decided to integrate Nmap with Python using the subprocess module. This small experiment turned into a practical lesson in automation, debugging, and understanding how system-level tools interact with application-level code. Why Automate Nmap? Nma…
