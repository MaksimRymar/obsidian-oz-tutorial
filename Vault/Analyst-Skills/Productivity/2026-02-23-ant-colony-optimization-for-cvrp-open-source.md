## What’s new and why it matters
​I just released a working implementation of an ACO algorithm to solve the Constrained Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Most routing systems are black boxes—I wanted to build something transparent that actually shows how to reduce costs and miles. ​What's inside: 🖥️ Core Repo: https://github.com/onRubik/CVRP-ACO 📓 Google Colab Demo: https://colab.research.google.com/github/onRubik/cvrp-routing-solver/blob/main/notebooks/cvrp_aco_demo.ipynb ​🎓 Gumroad Course: https://rubiklife.gumroad.com/l/vcxvrx ​It's ready to run in the Colab if you want to see the ants in action. Feedback on the architecture…
