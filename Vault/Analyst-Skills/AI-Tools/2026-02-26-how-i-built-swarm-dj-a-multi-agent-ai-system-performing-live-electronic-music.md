I wanted to explore whether autonomous AI agents could collaborate in real-time to generate music, argue over creative directions, and actually make crowds dance—without any human intervention. The result is a distributed, multi-agent AI system powered by Ollama , MQTT , and real-time DSP audio generation, turning AI agents into a collective, autonomous DJ. Watch the demo here: System Architecture Building an autonomous DJ meant bridging the gap between slow, toke…
