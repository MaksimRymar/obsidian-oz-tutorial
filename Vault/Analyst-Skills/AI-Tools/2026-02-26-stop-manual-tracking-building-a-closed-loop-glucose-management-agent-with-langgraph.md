## What’s new and why it matters
Managing metabolic health shouldn't feel like a second full-time job. With the rise of AI Agents and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) , we are entering an era where our devices don't just alert us to problems—they solve them. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to build a "closed-loop" health agent using LangGraph , OpenAI Tool Calling , and the Dexcom API to automate dietary interventions before a blood sugar spike even happens. By leveraging LangGraph's stateful orchestration , we can move beyond simple "if-this-then-that" logic into complex, self-correcting workflows. This approach is be…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
