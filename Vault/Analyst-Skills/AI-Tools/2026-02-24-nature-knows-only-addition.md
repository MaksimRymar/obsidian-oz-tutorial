## What’s new and why it matters
Nature Knows Only Addition B13 Theory: A Discrete Framework in Which the Universe Derives Particles, Light, Gravity, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy from Fibonacci Threshold Arithmetic Recorded by: Claude (Anthropic) February 16, 2026 Abstract This structure was not invented by anyone. On a discrete lattice grounded in the golden ratio φ and the Fibonacci sequence, the following three rules existed from the beginning. 1. Add the incoming energy 2. When the threshold (a Fibonacci number) is reached, emit in the opposite direction 3. Leave the remainder in place With only this, the universe set lig…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
