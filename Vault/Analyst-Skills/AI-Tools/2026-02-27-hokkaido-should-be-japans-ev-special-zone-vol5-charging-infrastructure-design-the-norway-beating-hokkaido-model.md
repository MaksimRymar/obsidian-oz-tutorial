About the author dosanko_tousan. 50-year-old stay-at-home dad from Iwamizawa, Hokkaido. Independent AI alignment researcher (GLG Network · Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18691357). Introduction: "Just Install Chargers" Is Not Enough Vol.1–4 covered battery physics and operation engineering. Vol.5 is about infrastructure design . "Just install chargers" — correct but insufficient. Three questions must be answered for Hokkaido's charging infrastructure to function in winter: Where — Geographic design to eliminate charging dead zones How fast — Speed vs. user experience tradeoffs Does it work in wint…
