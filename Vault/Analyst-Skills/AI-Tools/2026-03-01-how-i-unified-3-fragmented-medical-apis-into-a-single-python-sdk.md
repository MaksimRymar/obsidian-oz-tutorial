## What’s new and why it matters
I built MedKit because medical data is notoriously difficult to work with. If you want to correlate a drug's FDA label with its latest clinical trial phases and related research papers, you usually have to juggle three different APIs, handle idiosyncratic JSON schemas, and deal with inconsistent identifier types. MedKit is a unified Python SDK that transforms these fragmented sources (OpenFDA, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov) into a single, programmable platform. Key Features: Unified Client : One MedKit() client to rule them all. No more multiple API keys or manual correlation. Clinical Synthe…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
