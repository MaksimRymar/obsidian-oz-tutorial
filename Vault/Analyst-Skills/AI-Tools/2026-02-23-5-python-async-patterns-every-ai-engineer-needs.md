## What’s new and why it matters
Building performant and resilient AI applications, especially those interacting with large language models (LLMs) or other external APIs, demands sophisticated concurrency management. Traditional synchronous programming often becomes a bottleneck, leading to slow response times and inefficient resource utilization. Asynchronous Python, powered by asyncio , provides the tools necessary to overcome these challenges. This article explores five essential asyncio patterns crucial for any AI engineer optimizing their Python applications for speed, reliability, and scale. These patterns move beyond b…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
