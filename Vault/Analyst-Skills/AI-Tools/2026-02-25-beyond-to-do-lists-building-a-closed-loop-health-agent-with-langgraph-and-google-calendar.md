But what if your calendar was "health-aware"? Imagine an AI agent that detects a blood sugar spike or crash and automatically reschedules your next meeting to give you time for a walk or a specific meal. In this tutorial, we are building a Closed-Loop Health Intervention Agent . Using LangGraph for state management, we'll create a system that monitors Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) data, interacts with the Google Calen…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
