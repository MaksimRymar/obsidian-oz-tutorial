## What’s new and why it matters
Give Your AI Agent Long-Term Memory with SQLite and Ollama Every local LLM has the same problem: it forgets everything when the session ends. You build a useful AI assistant, have a great conversation, close the terminal — and next time you open it, the model has no idea who you are or what you discussed. The context window is a goldfish bowl. The fix is a memory layer : a persistent store that sits between your agent and the LLM, injecting relevant history into each new conversation. Here's how to build one with Python, SQLite, and Ollama — running entirely on local hardware. What We're Build…
