## What’s new and why it matters
Privacy is not just a feature; it’s a human right—especially when it comes to your health data. In the era of Local AI and Edge Computing , sending sensitive Electronic Health Records (EHR) to a cloud provider is becoming a gamble many aren't willing to take. If you are a developer looking to leverage the power of Llama-3 while ensuring 100% data sovereignty, you've come to the right place. 🚀 In this tutorial, we are going to build a Local-First Health AI using the MLX framework on Apple Silicon . We’ll transform raw, messy medical notes into structured data and concise summaries without a sin…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
