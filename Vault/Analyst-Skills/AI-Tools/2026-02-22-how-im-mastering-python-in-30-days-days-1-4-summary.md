## What’s new and why it matters
I’m a 19-year-old CS student transitioning from C++ logic to Python. I'm documenting my 30-day sprint to bridge the gap between academics and industry-level coding. 🏋️ Day 1: Health Tracker Forecast A predictive tool designed to forecast physical transformation over a 4-week period based on user activity levels. The Logic: Uses conditional branching (if-elif-else) to categorize user intensity into three tiers: Extreme Burn, Steady Progress, and Minimal Change. Input Validation: Implemented robust error handling using while True loops to ensure user inputs (workout days and step counts) stay wi…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
