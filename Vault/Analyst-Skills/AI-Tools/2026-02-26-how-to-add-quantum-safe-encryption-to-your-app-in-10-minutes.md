## What’s new and why it matters
RSA and ECDSA are on borrowed time. NIST finalized three post-quantum cryptography standards in 2024, and compliance mandates (CNSA 2.0, ANSSI) kick in starting 2025-2026. The "harvest now, decrypt later" threat is already real — adversaries are recording encrypted traffic today to crack it once quantum computers arrive. The good news: you don't need a PhD in lattice cryptography to migrate. In this tutorial, you'll encrypt and decrypt a message using NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms through simple REST calls. What you'll build: A complete encrypt/decrypt flow using ML-KEM-768 (FIPS 2…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
