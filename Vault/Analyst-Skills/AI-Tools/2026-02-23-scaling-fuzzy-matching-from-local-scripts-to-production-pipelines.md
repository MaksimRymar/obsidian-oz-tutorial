## What’s new and why it matters
I’ve handled fuzzy matching across the spectrum: academic research, scrappy startups, and enterprise-grade production environments. While the core objective—deduplicating or reconciling "messy" data—remains the same, the engineering constraints shift drastically as your row count climbs. At its heart, fuzzy matching is a two-dimensional problem: Precision : Defining similarity (Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler, Cosine, etc.). Scale : Managing the computational cost of comparisons. Most tutorials focus on the first. This article focuses on the second: the operational "pain bands" that force you to cha…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
