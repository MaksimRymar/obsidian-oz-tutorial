## What’s new and why it matters
You've been there. A service that needs a database, which needs a config, which needs an env variable that someone hardcoded three months ago and nobody remembers where. You're passing objects down ten layers of constructors. Testing means faking half your app. It's messy. And it doesn't have to be. Dependency Injection is the fix - but most Python DI libraries feel like they were designed for a different language. Overly complex, decorator-heavy, or magical in ways that make debugging a nightmare. So we built InjectQ . "We wanted DI that feels like Python - not like a Java framework that got…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
