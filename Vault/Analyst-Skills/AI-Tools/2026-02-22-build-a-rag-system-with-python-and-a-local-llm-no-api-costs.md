## What’s new and why it matters
Build a RAG System with Python and a Local LLM (No API Costs) RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is the most in-demand LLM skill in 2026. Every company wants to point an AI at their docs, their codebase, their knowledge base — and get useful answers back. The typical stack involves OpenAI embeddings + GPT-4 + a vector DB. The typical bill involves a credit card. Here's how to build the same thing entirely on local hardware : Python + Ollama + ChromaDB . No API keys. No per-token costs. Runs on a laptop or a home server. What We're Building A RAG pipeline that: Ingests documents (text files,…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
