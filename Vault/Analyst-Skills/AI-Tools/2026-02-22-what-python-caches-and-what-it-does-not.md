## What’s new and why it matters
Understanding Python’s Object Caching, Interning, and Memory Behavior Python performs several smart memory optimizations behind the scenes. One of the most important is object caching (interning) . Understanding this helps you: avoid tricky is bugs write memory-aware code answer tricky interview questions confidently 🔷 What Is Object Caching in Python? Python uses object caching (also called interning) as a performance optimization. Instead of creating new objects every time, Python reuses certain immutable objects to: reduce memory usage improve execution speed ⚠️ Important: Caching is an imp…
