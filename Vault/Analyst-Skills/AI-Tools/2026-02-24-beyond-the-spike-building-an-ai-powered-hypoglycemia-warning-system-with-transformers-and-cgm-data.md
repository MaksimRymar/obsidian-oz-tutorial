## What’s new and why it matters
Managing metabolic health is no longer about reactive finger-prick tests. With the rise of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) , we are drowning in data but starving for actionable insights. The real challenge? Time-series analysis of non-stationary biological data. Blood glucose isn't just a sequence of numbers; it’s a complex dance influenced by insulin, carbohydrates, and physical activity. In this tutorial, we are going to build a high-performance Transformer-based prediction model using PyTorch . By leveraging the Self-Attention mechanism , our model will learn to identify the subtle patt…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
