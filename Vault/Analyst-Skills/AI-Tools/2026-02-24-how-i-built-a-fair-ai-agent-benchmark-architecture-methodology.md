## What’s new and why it matters
Comparing frameworks is easy. Comparing them fairly is the hard part. In Part 1 of this series , I published the results of benchmarking five AI agent frameworks head-to-head. MS Agent Framework won on speed and consistency. Quality scores were nearly identical across the board. The results surprised me. But results without methodology are just opinions with charts. This article is about the engineering behind the benchmark: how I designed the system to isolate framework behavior from everything else, the architectural decisions that made fair comparison possible, and the mistakes I'd fix if I…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Reproduce the example in a notebook; then refactor into a reusable function.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
