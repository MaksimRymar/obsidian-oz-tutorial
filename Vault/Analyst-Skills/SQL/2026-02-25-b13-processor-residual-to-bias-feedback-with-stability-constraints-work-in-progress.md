## What’s new and why it matters
B13 Processor – Residual-to-Bias Feedback with Stability Constraints (Work in Progress) Abstract This note describes an experimental architectural concept called the B13 Processor . Unlike classical FFT-based processing, which performs linear basis decomposition, the B13 architecture treats internal residual energy ("heat", H) not as waste, but as a structured control signal. This document focuses on one specific mechanism: Error-to-Bias Feedback (H-Carrier) with explicit stability constraints. This is an engineering-oriented draft (Ver 0.9). 1. Motivation In most signal processing pipelines:…
