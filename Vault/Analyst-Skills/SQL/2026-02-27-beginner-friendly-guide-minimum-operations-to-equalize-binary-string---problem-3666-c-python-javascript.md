## What’s new and why it matters
In this challenge, we tackle a puzzle that feels like a digital light switch game. We need to find the most efficient way to turn all zeros into ones, but there is a catch: every move requires us to flip exactly $k$ switches at once. Problem Summary You're given: A binary string $s$ consisting of '0's and '1's. An integer $k$, representing the exact number of indices you must flip in a single operation. Your goal: Find the minimum number of operations required to make the entire string consist of only '1's. If it is impossible to reach this state, return -1. Intuition To solve this efficiently…

## How to apply
