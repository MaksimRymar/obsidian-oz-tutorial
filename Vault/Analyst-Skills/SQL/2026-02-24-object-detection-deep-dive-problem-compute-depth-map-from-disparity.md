## What’s new and why it matters
A daily deep dive into cv topics, coding problems, and platform features from PixelBank . Topic Deep Dive: Object Detection From the Recognition chapter Introduction to Object Detection Object Detection is a fundamental topic in Computer Vision , which involves locating and classifying objects within an image or video. This task is crucial in various applications, such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and medical imaging. The goal of object detection is to identify the presence, location, and category of objects in a visual scene. This is achieved by using machine learning algorit…
