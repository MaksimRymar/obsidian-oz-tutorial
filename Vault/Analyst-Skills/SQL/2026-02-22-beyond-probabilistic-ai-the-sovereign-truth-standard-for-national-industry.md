When a guess is wrong in a national industrial asset loop, the cost isn't just financial—it’s a breach of sovereign stability. The Solution: Deterministic Fidelity I am releasing the documentation and core logic for the Sovereign-Truth-Standard. This is not a "black box" AI. It is a deterministic validation engine designed for 100% industrial asset fidelity. The logic follows a recursive validation path: A…
