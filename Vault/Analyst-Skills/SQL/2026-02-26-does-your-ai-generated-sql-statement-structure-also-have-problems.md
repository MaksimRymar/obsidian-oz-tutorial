## What’s new and why it matters
I tried using an LLM to generate SQL across a messy legacy schema. It worked surprisingly well — until it didn’t. The biggest issue I hit wasn’t syntax. It was structurally incorrect JOIN paths that looked plausible. Curious if others have seen similar issues in real systems.

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Write the query in a scratchpad and run EXPLAIN/QUERY PLAN to verify performance.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
