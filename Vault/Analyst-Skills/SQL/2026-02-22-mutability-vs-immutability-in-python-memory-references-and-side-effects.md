## What’s new and why it matters
Understanding mutability is essential to avoid unexpected bugs and to truly grasp how Python manages memory efficiently. 📌 Mutability vs Immutability in Python (With Memory Behavior) Before diving deep, remember one core idea: Python variables are references to objects, not containers of values. This single concept explains most confusion around mutability. 🔷 What Does Assignment Mean in Python? In Python, variables do not store values directly. A = 4 This means: A refers to an object with value 4 Python follows name → object reference , not value copying 🔷 Immutable Objects in Python ✅ Common…
