## What’s new and why it matters
We built EdLight Code — a free platform where learners write and run Python, SQL, R, HTML/CSS/JS, and more directly in the browser. The Problem Setting up a development environment is the first barrier for new learners. Installing Python, configuring a database, setting up Node.js — these steps stop people before they write a single line of code. Our Approach Every exercise runs in the browser: Python → Pyodide (CPython compiled to WebAssembly) SQL → sql.js (SQLite in WASM) R → WebR HTML/CSS/JS → sandboxed iframes with live preview Spreadsheets/Slides/Word → custom browser-based editors What W…
