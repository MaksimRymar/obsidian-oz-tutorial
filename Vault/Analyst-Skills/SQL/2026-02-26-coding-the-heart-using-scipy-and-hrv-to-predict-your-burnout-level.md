## What’s new and why it matters
As developers, we are experts at debugging complex microservices, but we often ignore the most important system we'll ever maintain: our own body. Have you ever felt "fried" after a long sprint? That’s not just mental fatigue; it’s your Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) signaling for help. In this tutorial, we will dive deep into HRV signal processing and frequency domain analysis . We'll learn how to transform raw wearable data into actionable insights using the Python scientific stack. By calculating the LF/HF ratio , we can quantitatively assess stress levels and stop burnout before the "syste…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Write the query in a scratchpad and run EXPLAIN/QUERY PLAN to verify performance.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
