## What’s new and why it matters
Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, exponentiation, and floor division) seem simple, but their behavior differs across languages. Using them without understanding these differences can silently break production systems — especially in finance, analytics, or dashboards. In this guide, we’ll show real, practical examples for each language demonstrating all common operators in action. Before we step into the practical example, let me show you the list of available arithmetic operators across various platforms. Operator and Meaning + →Addition - → Subtraction * →Multiplication / →Division % →Modu…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Write the query in a scratchpad and run EXPLAIN/QUERY PLAN to verify performance.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
