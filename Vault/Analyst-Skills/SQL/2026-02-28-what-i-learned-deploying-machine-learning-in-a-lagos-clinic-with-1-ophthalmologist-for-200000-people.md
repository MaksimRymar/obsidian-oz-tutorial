## What’s new and why it matters
In 2021, I deployed a machine learning model that diagnosed 5 eye conditions with 87% accuracy at a Nigerian clinic with 1 ophthalmologist serving 200,000 people. The waiting time dropped. Not by minutes. By days. But getting there? That’s the story worth telling. The Problem Nobody Talks About Nigeria has roughly 200 million people. We have about 1,000 ophthalmologists. Do the math. I was working as a Clinical Analyst at Lagos State Primary Healthcare Board when I saw the pattern. Patients would show up at the eye hospital with symptoms. Then they’d wait. Sometimes weeks. By the time they got…
