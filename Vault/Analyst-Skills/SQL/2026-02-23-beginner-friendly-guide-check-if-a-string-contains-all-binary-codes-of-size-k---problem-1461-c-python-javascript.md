## What’s new and why it matters
Binary strings are the DNA of computing, representing everything from simple numbers to complex encrypted files. This problem challenges you to determine if a long sequence of data contains every possible "word" of a specific length, a task that mirrors how scanners detect patterns or corruption in digital streams. Problem Summary You're given: A binary string s consisting of only '0's and '1's. An integer k representing the required length of each binary substring. Your goal: Return true if every possible binary code of length k exists as a substring within s . Otherwise, return false . Intui…
