## What’s new and why it matters
Been flying FPV drones for about 2 years now. Love the flying part, but PID tuning? That's always been the part I dread. You know the drill - spend a weekend doing test flights, recording blackbox logs, staring at PIDtoolbox graphs trying to figure out what to change. Tweak P a bit, test again. Still got prop wash? Maybe try D term filtering. Rinse and repeat until you give up or get lucky. The Problem PIDtoolbox is great for analyzing logs, but it doesn't tell you what to actually change. You still need to understand all the theory - step response, noise floors, filter delays. Most of us just…

## How to apply
