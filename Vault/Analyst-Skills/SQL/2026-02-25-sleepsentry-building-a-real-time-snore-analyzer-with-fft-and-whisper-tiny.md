## What’s new and why it matters
Are you keeping the whole house awake with a "chainsaw" imitation every night? Or worse, are you worried about the silent gaps in breathing that signal Sleep Apnea ? 🛌 Identifying sleep patterns usually requires expensive medical equipment or bulky wearables. But what if we could turn a simple smartphone into a diagnostic tool? In this tutorial, we’re building SleepSentry —a sophisticated audio analysis pipeline that combines traditional Digital Signal Processing (DSP) with modern AI Speech Recognition . By leveraging Audio Analysis , Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) , and Whisper fine-tuning , we…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Write the query in a scratchpad and run EXPLAIN/QUERY PLAN to verify performance.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
