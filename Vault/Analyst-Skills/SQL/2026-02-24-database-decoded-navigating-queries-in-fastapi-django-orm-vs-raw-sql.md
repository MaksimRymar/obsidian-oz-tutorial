Let's dive deep into the world of Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) like SQLAlchemy (often paired with FastAPI) and Django's built-in ORM, compared to the raw power of SQL queries. By the end, you'll have a "foolproof" understanding of when and why to use each. The Big Three: SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, a…
