## What’s new and why it matters
Have you ever wished you could just ask your database a question in plain English and get an answer? That's exactly what we built—an experimental AI-powered chat interface that translates natural language into safe, read-only SQL queries. In this post, I'll walk you through how we built it, the security challenges we faced, and the performance optimizations that make it production-ready. The Problem We're Solving Most business users and even developers struggle with SQL. They know what data they want, but crafting the right query is time-consuming. Traditional BI tools require learning complex…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Write the query in a scratchpad and run EXPLAIN/QUERY PLAN to verify performance.
- Add a short note: what changed in your workflow?
