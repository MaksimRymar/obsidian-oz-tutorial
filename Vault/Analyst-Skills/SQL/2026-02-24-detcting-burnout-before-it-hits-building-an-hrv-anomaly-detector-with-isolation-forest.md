## What’s new and why it matters
Have you ever woken up feeling like a truck hit you, even though you "rested"? Or maybe you smashed a PR in the gym only to be sidelined by a cold 24 hours later? Our bodies often send distress signals long before we feel the symptoms. One of the most powerful signals is Heart Rate Variability (HRV) . In this tutorial, we’re going to build a predictive health pipeline using HRV Anomaly Detection , Isolation Forest , and Python . By leveraging unsupervised learning, we can identify "outlier" days that signify early overtraining or oncoming infection. If you're looking to master wearable data an…

## How to apply
- Extract 1 actionable tactic from this post and try it on a real dataset this week.
- Write the query in a scratchpad and run EXPLAIN/QUERY PLAN to verify performance.
